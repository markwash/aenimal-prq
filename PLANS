PRQuadtree interface:

PRQ *new()
void free(PRQ *)

struct point {
	double x, y;
	void *data;
};

int insert(PRQ *, point_t pt)
int remove(PRQ *, point_t pt)

struct point_iter_ctx;


plans:

- associates points with values (void * generic)
- insert and remove points
- iterate over points in the tree
- get nearest point to a given point
- get k-nearest-points to a given point (as iterator?)
- ability to efficiently move an existing point a small distance?
  * or should this just be remove and re-insert?
